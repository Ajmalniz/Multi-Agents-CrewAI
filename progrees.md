## Identified Issues and Blockers

### Lack of Progress on Key Features
All major tasks currently reside in the "To Do" status, indicating a complete standstill in development. This represents a critical bottleneck in our workflow, preventing the project from advancing.

### Urgent Task with Delayed Approvals
The task "Approve the Planning" is marked as urgent and has surpassed its due date (August 16, 2024). Joao Moura's feedback suggests challenges faced during this phase, indicating a need for reevaluation of our resources and processes to avoid similar delays.

### Stalled Communication
There is a significant lack of comments on tasks, suggesting that team members are not engaging actively. This absence of communication could lead to misunderstandings and further delays as the planning phase progresses.

## Progress and Delays

### Current Progress
The project is experiencing stagnation, with nothing moving to "In Progress" status.

### Delays
The overdue task "Approve the Planning" has created a significant bottleneck, preventing other dependent tasks from being addressed. These include:
- "Scaffold of the Initial App UI"
- "Planning of the Project"
- "Analysis of Results from CSV"

All tasks remain unaddressed due to the standstill on planning approvals, indicating a domino effect that could derail project timelines.

## Team Performance Overview
Overall team engagement appears low due to unclear communication channels and absence of discussions around tasks. The limited interaction among team members could lead to further delays and reduced productivity moving forward.

## Action Items and Recommendations

### Schedule a Focused Meeting
Organize a meeting to clearly address the planning issues, allowing Joao to share specific challenges. This could help surface unaddressed blockers and re-align the team on project goals.

### Assign Clear Deadlines and Responsibilities
Establish specific deadlines for each task along with designated team members responsible for them. This will instill accountability and ensure timely progress.

### Encourage Ongoing Dialogue
Foster a culture of open communication on the Trello board to promote collaboration and keep the team engaged and updated on activities.

### Re-evaluate Resources
Investigate the potential need for additional resources or personnel to assist in overcoming the specific challenges presented in the planning phase, ensuring future tasks can progress without delay.

By addressing these critical issues, engaging the team effectively, and implementing the recommended action items, we can mitigate further delays and create a more streamlined project trajectory moving forward.
